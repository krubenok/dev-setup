# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles (and a few setup scritps). I was largely inspired by [Mike McQuaid](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid) and his [Strap tool](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap). As such, these dotfiles are compatible with Strap and has scripts where it's expecting them.

My Brewfile is fairly heavy so do be careful and don't just run this blindly. Use it as inspiration and re-write your own.

## How to Install
